The decision maker (DM) requires efficiency when managing a complex technical system. 

DM must analyze a large amount of information under time constraints to obtain a high-quality decision. 

Various decision support systems (DSS) are used to solve this problem. 

However, the problem of considering the uncertainty of human reasoning arises when using DSS to control complex technical systems. 

Usually, this problem is solved using fuzzy logic mechanisms. 

Also, it is necessary to consider the characteristics of the domain and the formalization of accumulated knowledge when developing a DSS. 

Therefore, tools are needed to integrate knowledge engineering methods and fuzzy inference mechanisms. 

An analysis of sources showed that there is no ready-to-use solution. 

The approach to constructing a fuzzy logical inference system based on Semantic Web technologies is proposed. 

This choice is based on widespread use of these technologies as the basis of knowledge bases.
